Hi!

This project is my rendition of the "Project: CV Application" from TOP.
As of release 1.0 (2024-08-15) all the required specifications were achieved!
That being said, this is also my playground to test new things, so below you can see a list of some features to be implemented in the future.
If you're visiting here because you're thinking of hiring me just remember that my projects are not all bloated like this, what I do here is to practice and just for fun to be honest.
I can do all the stuff that you see there though, so just don't think too hard why this has a dev mode inside of it and focus on...wait, 'dev mode'?

To do:
-Refactor 'SectionForm' component. It's too cluttered at the moment.
-Allow only one 'general info' block.
-Add option to stop filling a form (a close button or something).
-Add option to 'cancel' an editing.
-Add an export option for the info on the sections, generating a real CV (pdf).
-Refactor to be WCAG 2 'AA' compliant.
-Add 'dark mode'.
-Add 'template mode' ('dark mode' but better, similar to pacman board skins).
-Add 'template mode' for CV exporting (the user will be able to select a template to generate the CV).
-Add 'dev mode' ('real time visualization' of components or option to edit some configurations of the components, or both, or more).
-Add local save of the data.
-Guarantee that the page is responsive enough, and if needed implement different layouts for the page for classes of devices.
-Typography (leaving it at that because that's a whole can of worms).
-Redesign (read above â¤´).
-Add server save of the data (limited to me).
-Add auto filling by getting the data from another place (could I import the data from Linkedin if the user allows it? Do they need to have an account here to do that?).
-Allow user to upload a picture via some image recognition API to get the fields of a preexisting physical CV.
-Expand the sections to contemplate the most common type of info observed in CV's.
-Easter Eggs (place the clickable ones based on the heat map, so the average user does not accidentally go there).
-Change title.
-Add credits.
